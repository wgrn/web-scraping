# web-scraping
Web scraping program developed in Python 3 using regular expressions.

Get files (Y/N): Y

If you're on Windows you'll have to change the WORKDIR constant in the line 26 of the data.py file.

Note: 
In order for the program to properly work the first time, you have to download some html files (about 8 minutes and 148.8 MB), the subsecuent times when the files are already downloaded you should enter Get files (Y/N): N, otherwise the program will re-write all those files and take about 8 minutes.
